        <h3>Here's how to prepare the traditional Florentine steak!</h3>
        <p>Nearly every Tuscan home cook is an expert at bistecca fiorentina, a traditional Florentine steak recipe that calls for only five ingredients. The steak is typically from Chianina cattle — an ancient Tuscan breed known for its prized and tasty meat — seasoned with local spices and grilled over red-hot coals. It’s traditionally served “rare,” but we won’t judge if you ask for medium. (Not too much, anyway).</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 T-bone or porterhouse steak, at least 3 inches thick & 3-3½ pounds</li>
                <li>1 bunch fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>1 bunch fresh sage</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>        
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a grill pan on medium-high heat. Pat the steak dry, and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Tie the rosemary and sage bunches together with butcher’s twine to form an herb brush. Use the herbs to brush the steak with olive oil.</li>
                <li>Place the steak on the grill pan, and char it well: cook about 12 minutes on the first side, flip, and cook about 9 minutes on the second side. Like we said earlier, this steak is traditionally served rare.</li>
                <li>When the steak is done, remove it from the grill pan and allow it to stand for 5 minutes so that the juices are retained when the meat is cut. Carve off the fillet and strip steaks, and slice before serving. Serve hot, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
